setup
ros-indigo-jackal-simulator ros-indigo-jackal-desktop

the standard launch systems for simulation applies. 

roslaunch jackal_gazebo jackal_world.launch front_laser:=true 
throws you gazebo with the front_laser. Probable chance to update a 
config option to also have the tango information

roslaunch jackal_viz view_robot.launch
throws rviz, in which you can add the laser data from the /scan topic

For new nodes to control from the plans, publishing to the /cmd_vel topics to dirve with geometry/Twist messages.

This simulation includes the slippage and skidding (observed) and obviously mass and inertial properties that gazebo is good at. I will have to take a look to see what the story is on the skidding/slipping stuff knowing that different floors change COF and other parameters

Format of each of the elements (control via differential driver controller) and the planner just needs to publish to the /cmd_vel topic and various things can subscribe to the odom/etc topics for pushed data. 

How to activate hardware from the fakeness? 

what data compes back (encoder vel/pos, temp of a couple parts, IMU lin/ang anything else?)

current planner implemented on ros_planning

NEXT figure out the navigation launch files, how fake --> real, URDF tango, rostango


rostopic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist '{linear: {x: 1.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}, angular: {x: 0.0, y: 0.0, z: 0.0}}'
to publish velocities to the controller
